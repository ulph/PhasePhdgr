Read my lips...
Suck my balls!

## core / synth ##

As long as you work with the JUCE-less parts, leave cmake options at default.

## json format ##

We rely on nlhomann/json for this. 

Our code expects nlhomann/json.hpp in include path. There is a field in our CMAKE for it.

## VST / JUCE ##

Download or clone JUCE SDK and VST3 SDK. There's an option for either in our CMAKE, fill those in...

### Notes ###

* We use parts of the build template from VST3 SDK, but modified to play ball with JUCE5... (JUCE implements the entry point to the VST itself rather than the SDK specified entry point...)

* We have the autogenerated define+source includes from Projucer checked in. We _could_ potentially avoid that, but the defines in Appconfig.h would then have to be set by CMAKE, and the files are 2-liners anyway typically...

* It is a bit unclear whether we build VST2 or VST3, or both, for all platforms. Whatever the HOST claims it is, I suppose. Examples from VST3 SDK did not work on Linux, whereas JUCE based does (such as our synth). Fishy.
